## Design System Changes

### Color Palette Standardization
- **Primary Color:** Changed from indigo/purple to blue (#3B82F6)
- **Success:** Green (#10B981)
- **Error:** Red (#EF4444)

## Impact Summary

### Before
- Complex glassmorphism effects and backdrop filters
- Multiple gradient color schemes (indigo, purple, blue)
- Excessive framer-motion animations
- Inconsistent border radius (rounded-full, rounded-2xl, rounded-lg)
- Complex shadow systems and visual effects
- Varying color schemes across components

### After
